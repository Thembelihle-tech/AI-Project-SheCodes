            Photosynthesis is the vital process where plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (sugars/glucose) for energy and growth, 
            <br/> releasing oxygen as a byproduct, which is essential for most life on Earth. 
            <br/>This occurs in chloroplasts, using the green pigment chlorophyll to capture light energy, 
            <br/>converting it into chemical energy that fuels the creation of carbohydrates from simple inorganic molecules.
